Passage Through Insanity is a 48h Game Jam Project made by a team of 4 programmers using Unity3D (without any graphic-designer so we only used free graphical assets from the store ahah).

## Description of the Game
Passage Through Insanity is a horror FPS game where you wake up in the middle of a desert. Alone in the dark, you have nothing more than your smartphone that can be used as a torchlight.

## Objective
- A message on your phone tolds you to look for a knife and a scroll. Search carefully but quickly for theses items in the desert because you're subject to become more and more insane through this journey ...
- When you find an item, you will be teleported in a level and you have to reach the end of it to return in the desert

## Notes
- The insanity bar is filling up really fast so dont waste your time ! 
- Cubes and balls dropping from the sky ARE scary ok ! (Ok, there were just placeholder for mobs, but we didn't have enough time...)

## Devs 
- Nicolas Lutz
- Robin Chavignat
- Alexandre Nopre
- Arthur Scheidel
